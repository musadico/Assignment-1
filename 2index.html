          The Kogi State Government, on Sunday, said that there was an
          assassination attempt on the state governor, Yahaya Bello, a few
          kilometres away from Abuja, on his way to an official engagement from
          Lokoja, the state capital. According to a statement issued by the
          state Commissioner for information, Kingsley Fanwo, it stated that the
          attack occurred at about 4 p.m. on Sunday, October 22, 2023. According
          to him, “The attackers who were dressed in military uniforms waylaid
          the governor’s convoy and started shooting sporadically at his vehicle
          and other vehicles in the convoy. It took the swift intervention of
          the security personnel attached to the governor to foil the satanic
          plans of the unknown soldiers.” He said that the attacks were at three
          different points, the last barricade being around Kwali Federal
          Capital Territory at about 4.20 p.m.
